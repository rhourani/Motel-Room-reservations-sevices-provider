# Motel-Room-reservations-sevices-provider

# In this program a room reservation service is offered to the hotel owner by adding a new customer to an empty room or removing a customer from a full room.
# The data is automatically saved in a text file on each addition of a new entry,
# A register is also deleted when you delete a room by entering the room number,
# The room number acts as an ID number from which we can identify the customer's name and personal information in the database.

# The program had been programmed by C language as a Console Application.
